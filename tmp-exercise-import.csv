Engage your core and ensure your posture is upright. Start by hopping forward on one foot, always keeping the other foot off the ground. As you hop, swing one arm forward and one arm back to maintain balance and mimic running mechanics. After completing the hops on one side, switch to your other foot and repeat the same process. Keep in mind, that arms must swing opposite to the hop, mimicking the natural arm swing during running. Aim for a rhythmical, springy hop rather than a high or long jump. Your landing foot should spring off the ground as soon as it touches down, emphasising the reactive strength component. After completing the first set on both sides moving forward, do the same moving left and then moving right. Each time, you should keep minimal ground contact time as the focus, rather than height or distance.","48 (8f, 8,r, 8l, each side)","2","'-","60s","[""Max Velocity""]","[""Calves"",""Glutes"",""Quadriceps""]","c023e76a-4caa-4631-a89e-4c107f1df393",2025-01-24T03:12:59Z,2025-03-21T19:59:53Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"

The end box should be 5x5x5. The larger box should be 10 metres long on top of the end box and the end line should have two end points diagonal from the end box (think of centre-field
in baseball).

2. One player starts on the goalline and one inside the end box. The player on the goalline
should whip the ball into the end box at speed or in the air to make it difficult to control.

3. Within 2 touches the player in the end zone should exit the end box through either of two
smaller 1m exit zones. Once outside they can be tacked.

4. The other player is able to press at speed as soon as they play the ball and should have
gotten tight into a 1v1.

5. The player on the ball must reach the long goal line and stop the ball dead on it to score (and keep on as the attacker). The game is over if the ball leaves the box any other way and players should subsequently switch roles.

6. Free-kicks are given if a player is fouled (the defender may not press until the attacker takes
their first touch).

Penalties are given if a player is fouled when ahead of the defender and through on goal (the defender may not press until the attacker has left the end box).","30 minutes","2","'-","5 minutes","[""Anaerobic Endurance""]","[""Glutes"",""Quadriceps"",""Hamstrings"",""Core""]","ccffe61e-26b8-4a6a-8fa4-aa89a5c706a6",2025-02-05T08:51:57Z,2025-02-05T11:16:45Z,"c4f4b179-106b-4a27-b593-e24126c1a62d"
